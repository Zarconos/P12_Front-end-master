## App Structure

The structure of the HR Net application is organized as follows:

- **App.js**: Main app component responsible for routing and overall application setup.
- **pages/**: Contains page components for each route in the application.
  - **employee-list.js**: Page component responsible for displaying the list of employees.
  - **home.js**: Page component responsible for displaying the form to add/edit employees.
- **components/**: Contains reusable component used throughout the application.
  - **Table.js**: Reusable component responsible for displaying a list of employees.

## Redux Integration

Redux is integrated into the application for managing application state. Here's a brief overview of the Redux setup:

- **redux/**: Contains Redux-related files.
  - **reducers.js**: Defines Redux reducers to update application state based on actions.
  - **store.js**: Creates the Redux store and combines reducers.
- **App.js**: Wraps the entire application with the Redux `<Provider>` to provide the store to all components.

This structured organization helps maintain clarity and separation of concerns within the project.
